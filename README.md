As a developer who uses javascript on the daily I often stick a quick console.log into my code and forget to remove them. So with this in mind I decided to create an extension to clean them up for me.

I hope this benefits developers like myself who are often at the hand of being punished for not removing them üòÇ

  

## Features

  
### V0.0.1
Press `ctrl+shift+p` and type Bye Console Logs to activate the extension. It will then present you with a dialog box displaying how many console logs it's found and if you want to proceed getting rid of them.

### V0.0.3
